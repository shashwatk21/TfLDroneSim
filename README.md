## Support

We enable AirSim to have support for Unreal Engine 5.11 with improved dynamics.

- Improved Air Drag, Turbulence, Wind for better Drone Physics
- Support for Dynamic Weather and Timing
- Improved Communication speed with the client and server for faster training

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Epic Games Launcher installed
2. Install Unreal Engine 5.1x
3. Run build.cmd on Windows to build the plugin
4. Install the environments from the repository and store in Unreal/Environments
5. Run the environments with generated plugin from Unreal/Plugins into the Plugins folder inside the environment downloaded
6. Run the AirSim
7. Run files from PythonClient/reinforcement_learning/algos/ and PythonClient/reinforcement_learning/transfer/ to initiate drone learning. You can modify the parameters for dynamic weather, action space, and other configurations.
